This app is intended to be a tool for sending Morse code via an Android device. 

Future versions will include more options & Morse->Latin letter transcription via the camera.

###Notes

**Morse Flash** supports **Android 2.3.3** and over. It is currently an open beta pending new features and fixes and can be found on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ovrhere.android.morseflash "Find 'Morse Flash' on Google Play"). 

Application requires the compatibility v7 library. Uses resources from [Android Holo Colors Generator](http://android-holo-colors.com/ "Android Holo Colors Generator").

Unit testing is done in another project/repository (to be uploaded later).

Messages are inputted in Latin based letters and converted to [international Morse code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code "Morse Code - Wikipedia") according to [official standards](http://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-M.1677-1-200910-I/  "Official standards - M.1677 : International Morse code").

Messages can be sent either by flashing the screen or camera flash.

The camera flash functionality has thus far been tested on 3 separate hardware profiles and, as such, is experimental.
