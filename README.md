#Morse Flash

This app is intended to be a tool for sending Morse code via an Android device. 

Future versions will include more options & Morse->Latin letter transcription via the camera.

###Notes

The app supports **Android 2.3.3** and up. App is currently a closed alpha/beta in the testing & touch up stages, pending release.

Application requires the compatibility v7 library. Uses resources from [Android Holo Colors Generator](http://android-holo-colors.com/).

Unit testing is done in another project/repository (to be uploaded later).

Messages are inputted in Latin based letters and converted to [international Morse code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) according to [official standards](http://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-M.1677-1-200910-I/).

Messages can be sent either by flashing the screen or camera flash.

The camera flash functionality is currently not fully tested and, as such, experimental.
