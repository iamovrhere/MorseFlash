#Morse Flash

This app is intended to be a utility for sending morse code via an Android device. 

Future versions may include morse->latin letter translation functionality.

###Notes

The app supports **Android 2.3.3** and up.

Message are inputted in latin based letters and converted to [international morse code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) according to [official standards](http://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-M.1677-1-200910-I/).

Messages can be sent either by flashing the screen or flashlight.

The camera flashlight functionality is currently untested and, as such, experimental.
